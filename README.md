# Nginx Ingress on GKE kubernetes cluster

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-go.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

We will deploy 2 pods and dispach traffic with the NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes

Requirements

- A Cluster Already Online
- Helm on your local machine

## Step 1 : Initialize Helm , Install Tiller and give Tiller some rights

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes and the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

```
kubectl apply -f rbac-config.yaml
```

```
helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade
```

## Step 2 : Install Nginx Ingress with Helm

In Kubernetes, Ingress is an object that allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. You configure access by creating a collection of rules that defines which inbound connections reach which services.

```
helm install stable/nginx-ingress --name nginx-ingress --namespace nginx-ingress --set rbac.create=true --set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local
```

Next we will need the Ingress `EXTERNAL-IP`

```
kubectl --namespace nginx-ingress get services
```

Now you can point 2 subdomains ( TYPE A ) on the `EXTERNAL-IP`

Propagation can be long so wait for it ðŸ˜´

## Step 3 : Deploy 2 Differents services

We will deploy 2 `hashicorp/http-echo` server an use the ingress to point on subdomains.

First create the fruits namespace

```
kubectl create namespace fruits
```

Deploy the http-echo servers

```
kubectl apply -f apple.yml
```

```
kubectl apply -f banana.yml
```

Now, edit `fruits.yml` with your custom domains and deploy the fruits ingress

```
kubectl apply -f fruits.yml
```

And voila !

## Clear the Stack

You can delete the `fruits` and `nginx-ingress` Namespaces
